                <p>The crypto markets seem to be showing signs of more than a seasonal reset with the inflated economy.
                    The last major downturn was in 2017 when Bitcoin lost nearly half its value (from $19,783.06 to
                    below $11,000) in just five days. By the time the volatile market fully recovered some 24 months
                    later, many crypto projects had folded but others were just getting started. </p>
                <p>Enter Proton Blockchain (not yet two years old) that already has a suite of products built around an
                    amazing ecosystem; which includes the features of  Web3 connectivity (WebAuth.com); cross blockchain
                    swaps (ProtonSwap); yield farming (farming pools); and the latest addition–ProtonLoan–a completely
                    trustless DeFi platform that enables the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrency all using Proton's
                    uniquely efficient model of zero gas fees, combined with its own xtokens (wrapped versions of some
                    of the most popular crypto currencies). To fully understand the end goal for Proton Blockchain, one
                    needs to follow the recurring theme of the messaging used by Protonchain CEO Marshall Hayner on
                    social media:</p>

                <p>Instead of waiting for the perfect regulatory climate in which to launch a nationally chartered FDIC
                    insured bank, the tweet above (on January 23, 2022) indicates that Marshall/Metallicus will likely
                    apply for a SPDI license in a single state. Why? Because it will expedite the creation of a bank
                    while they can still enjoy a first-mover advantage. Remember only FBB&amp;T can claim to have a bank
                    that runs on their own blockchain (like Protonchain) and feature their own wrapped xtokens. There
                    are many reasons why Protonchain's “First Blockchain Bank”  will open next year and why choosing the
                    right location matters.</p>
                <p>This goal to be the First Blockchain Bank and Trust (FBB&amp;T) is the long game for Proton and Metal
                    Pay owned by parent company Metallicus. Hayner is firmly at the helm of both enterprises synergized
                    together through a series of updates and releases including: Proton(DeFI) + Metal Pay(fiat on/off
                    ramp) + FBBT (full regluatory compliance/securities expemption) = the crpyto bank for the 21st
                    century. But then came some setbacks. At Money 20/20 October 2021, @MarshallHayner– the CEO of the
                    Proton Blockchain and Metallicus announced that his team had applied then withdrawn their Federal
                    banking charter application pending changes and guidance from Federal Banking Regulators. This plan
                    for FBB&amp;T (on Protonchain) to become a full service national charter bank was delayed due in
                    part to a regluatory cloud that formed with the incoming Biden administration. During this interim
                    period, few new banks were formed, with none at the national level. Instead the OCC (Office of the
                    Comptroller of the Currency) acceptance has trended towards state licenced entities. </p>
                <p>Since the Dodd-Frank Banking Regulations of 1997 were enacted, hundreds of national banks and federal
                    savings banks across the United States have now converted to state charters. “These banks typically
                    cite three reasons for converting: cost savings and increased earnings, [improved] regulatory access
                    and relationships, and the dilution (or disuse) of [restrictive] national bank powers.” (<a
                        href="https://www.bankdirector.com/issues/weighing-benefits-state-charter/">https://www.bankdirector.com/issues/weighing-benefits-state-charter/</a>
                    )  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Banking Act resulted in significant cutbacks and a reduction in
                    the availability of federal preemption or having to comply with differing state laws. With the
                    majority of national banks being community banks that do not actually operate nationally, this and
                    favorable state laws now make State chartered Banks the best choice for many financial institutions.
                </p>
                <p>However, in the absence of any specific Federal regulations on cryprocurrencies, thirty-three states
                    and Puerto Rico have taken the lead to enact pending legislation for reviewing crypto regulations
                    with another seventeen states having already enacted legislation to regulate or license digital
                    currency (token) transmissions. Such state regulations cover 1) the use of cryptocurrencies as legal
                    tender in business transactions (including taxation), 2) and/or impose regulations for
                    cryptocurrency exchanges as money transmitters, 3) and define the legal the status of smart
                    contracts and crypto-tokens. Here is a list of current or <a
                        href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/cryptocurrency-2021-legislation.aspx#:~:text=Thirty%2Dthree%20states%20and%20Puerto,blockchain%20and%20cryptocurrency%20study%20committee">pending
                        crypto-legislation by state</a>. </p>
                <p>So far, only a few states (like California, Wyoming, Florida, Texas, and Colorado) are considered
                    crypto-friendly states to have adapted none of the restrictive commercial laws against blockchain
                    innovation or else passed friendly digital asset regulations and licensing requirements. For
                    instance, Wyoming is considered to have the one of the most crypto-friendly regulations in the
                    United States; including tax breaks for crypto transactions; approval of two new crypto-bank
                    charters ( Kraken Financial and Avanti); and over 20 laws that make it easier for crypto businesses
                    to operate. Note: Although Wyoming is not FDIC insured for state banks, their SPDI (special-purpose
                    depository institution) license provides banking oversight. But Texas does have FDIC insurance for
                    state banks. And as a hub for Bitcoin miners, Texas in 2021 recognizes the legal status and
                    protection of cryptocurrencies to pave the way for state banks to provide custody services for
                    cryptocurrency and transmitter services.</p>
                <p>In California, the Office of Financial Technology and Innovation will reportedly help create new
                    crypto-specific rules to attract and encourage crypto-businesses and increase its 2,473 crypto ATMs.
                    Colorado also passed great crypto-friendly laws and wants to allow for crypto tax payments. Florida
                    is another crypto-friendly state that is about to accept crypto payments toward certain state taxes
                    and Miami City is trying to become a crypto-hub. As an honorable mention, Montana has no sales and
                    use taxes and they passed a law (30-10-105 MCA) to recognize crypto tokens (called utility tokens)
                    and exempted them from state securities since 2019.</p>
                <p><br />Amoung all these crypto-friendly states, the clear winner for Marshall (Protonchain) to host
                    his First Blockchain Bank is either Texas or Wyoming. Both states already have laws on the books for
                    the legal status and protection of cryptocurrencies. Both states also have crypto-friendly governors
                    and legislators, and both states offer tax breaks or incentives for crypto-services. Wyoming
                    incentives include a cryptocurrency staking program and advisory council; matching funds related to
                    carbon capture, utilization and storage projects; and the formation and management of DAOs
                    (decentralized autonomous organizations). Texas offers even better incentives; such as "10-year tax
                    abatement, sales tax credits and workforce training from the state” and crypto-friendly laws (like
                    Business and Commerce Codes-Chapter 12) to legally allow state-chartered banks to provide clients
                    with Virtual crypto-currencies custodial services simply by “filing a financing [ID] statement” and
                    showing “exclusive transfer control” or “shared” possession with  private wallet keys held in
                    escrow. (<a
                        href="https://www.omm.com/resources/alerts-and-publications/alerts/texas-uniform-commercial-code-updated-to-recognize-cryptocurrency">source</a>:)
                </p>
                <p>But Wyoming can not compete with the Texas State Constitution (Article XVI, Section 16(c)) that
                    insures Texas state-chartered banks are at least equal in powers, rights and privileges to their
                    federal counterparts, which may be better than federal banks in some cases. "Of particular interest
                    is a "super parity" provision which provides a framework for a state bank chartered in Texas, upon
                    application, to conduct any of the activities allowed by any other insured state or federal
                    financial institution in the nation...[so this] dramatically increases Texas’ appeal as a central
                    location from which to conduct nationwide banking activities…[because] there is no "super parity"
                    provision available to national banks. (Section 32.010 of the Texas Finance Code)." <a

                    Thus, Texas generously giving state banks these expanded powers, higher legal lending limits, and
                    parity with national banks may be the best reasons of all for Protonchain to charter their first
                    Bank in Texas.</p>
                <p><br />Perhaps these banking benefits help explain why, last December (2021), we saw part of the
                    Metallicus team join Marshall for a visit to the Texas capital. This visit for no apparent reason
                    was made public a few days later by this photograph shared here in this tweet:</p>

                <p>What is certain is that sooner or later, Marshall will receive his first State Bank charter likely no
                    later than 2023. But one has to wonder if Marshall and his Proton Blockchain were signaling in this
                    tweet above that they have already been laying the groundwork to open their First Blockchain Bank in
                    Texas! Our bet is that Marshall has already chosen his Bank location for the reasons above and added
                    bonus of Texas being the 9th or 10th largest economy in the world! </p>
                <p>The Protonchain team has recognized by future-proofing their blockchain with a Blockchain Bank they
                    can merge traditional and decentralized finance unlocking banking access 24/7 for everyone, so that
                    no one gets left behind!</p>
