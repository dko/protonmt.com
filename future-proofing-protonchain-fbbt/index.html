                            <p>The crypto markets seem to be showing signs of more than a seasonal reset with the
                                inflated economy. The last major downturn was in 2017 when Bitcoin lost nearly half its
                                value (from $19,783.06 to below $11,000) in just five days. By the time the volatile
                                market fully recovered some 24 months later, many crypto projects had folded but others
                                were just getting started. </p>
                            <p>Enter Proton Blockchain (not yet two years old) that already has a suite of products
                                built around an amazing ecosystem; which includes the features of  Web3 connectivity
                                (WebAuth.com); cross blockchain swaps (ProtonSwap); yield farming (farming pools); and
                                the latest addition–ProtonLoan–a completely trustless DeFi platform that enables the
                                borrowing and lending of cryptocurrency all using Proton's uniquely efficient model of
                                zero gas fees, combined with its own xtokens (wrapped versions of some of the most
                                popular crypto currencies). To fully understand the end goal for Proton Blockchain, one
                                needs to follow the recurring theme of the messaging used by Protonchain CEO Marshall
                                Hayner on social media:</p>

                            <p>Instead of waiting for the perfect regulatory climate in which to launch a nationally
                                chartered FDIC insured bank, the tweet above (on January 23, 2022) indicates that
                                Marshall/Metallicus will likely apply for a SPDI license in a single state. Why? Because
                                it will expedite the creation of a bank while they can still enjoy a first-mover
                                advantage. Remember only FBB&amp;T can claim to have a bank that runs on their own
                                blockchain (like Protonchain) and feature their own wrapped xtokens. There are many
                                reasons why Protonchain's “First Blockchain Bank”  will open next year and why choosing
                                the right location matters.</p>
                            <p>This goal to be the First Blockchain Bank and Trust (FBB&amp;T) is the long game for
                                Proton and Metal Pay owned by parent company Metallicus. Hayner is firmly at the helm of
                                both enterprises synergized together through a series of updates and releases including:
                                Proton(DeFI) + Metal Pay(fiat on/off ramp) + FBBT (full regluatory compliance/securities
                                expemption) = the crpyto bank for the 21st century. But then came some setbacks. At
                                Money 20/20 October 2021, @MarshallHayner– the CEO of the Proton Blockchain and
                                Metallicus announced that his team had applied then withdrawn their Federal banking
                                charter application pending changes and guidance from Federal Banking Regulators. This
                                plan for FBB&amp;T (on Protonchain) to become a full service national charter bank was
                                delayed due in part to a regluatory cloud that formed with the incoming Biden
                                administration. During this interim period, few new banks were formed, with none at the
                                national level. Instead the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) acceptance
                                has trended towards state licenced entities. </p>
                            <p>Since the Dodd-Frank Banking Regulations of 1997 were enacted, hundreds of national banks
                                and federal savings banks across the United States have now converted to state charters.
                                “These banks typically cite three reasons for converting: cost savings and increased
                                earnings, [improved] regulatory access and relationships, and the dilution (or disuse)
                                of [restrictive] national bank powers.” (<a
                                    href="https://www.bankdirector.com/issues/weighing-benefits-state-charter/">https://www.bankdirector.com/issues/weighing-benefits-state-charter/</a>
                                )  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Banking Act resulted in significant cutbacks and a
                                reduction in the availability of federal preemption or having to comply with differing
                                state laws. With the majority of national banks being community banks that do not
                                actually operate nationally, this and favorable state laws now make State chartered
                                Banks the best choice for many financial institutions. </p>
                            <p>However, in the absence of any specific Federal regulations on cryprocurrencies,
                                thirty-three states and Puerto Rico have taken the lead to enact pending legislation for
                                reviewing crypto regulations with another seventeen states having already enacted
                                legislation to regulate or license digital currency (token) transmissions. Such state
                                regulations cover 1) the use of cryptocurrencies as legal tender in business
                                transactions (including taxation), 2) and/or impose regulations for cryptocurrency
                                exchanges as money transmitters, 3) and define the legal the status of smart contracts
                                and crypto-tokens. Here is a list of current or <a
                                    href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/cryptocurrency-2021-legislation.aspx#:~:text=Thirty%2Dthree%20states%20and%20Puerto,blockchain%20and%20cryptocurrency%20study%20committee">pending
                                    crypto-legislation by state</a>. </p>
                            <p>So far, only a few states (like California, Wyoming, Florida, Texas, and Colorado) are
                                considered crypto-friendly states to have adapted none of the restrictive commercial
                                laws against blockchain innovation or else passed friendly digital asset regulations and
                                licensing requirements. For instance, Wyoming is considered to have the one of the most
                                crypto-friendly regulations in the United States; including tax breaks for crypto
                                transactions; approval of two new crypto-bank charters ( Kraken Financial and Avanti);
                                and over 20 laws that make it easier for crypto businesses to operate. Note: Although
                                Wyoming is not FDIC insured for state banks, their SPDI (special-purpose depository
                                institution) license provides banking oversight. But Texas does have FDIC insurance for
                                state banks. And as a hub for Bitcoin miners, Texas in 2021 recognizes the legal status
                                and protection of cryptocurrencies to pave the way for state banks to provide custody
                                services for cryptocurrency and transmitter services.</p>
                            <p>In California, the Office of Financial Technology and Innovation will reportedly help
                                create new crypto-specific rules to attract and encourage crypto-businesses and increase
                                its 2,473 crypto ATMs. Colorado also passed great crypto-friendly laws and wants to
                                allow for crypto tax payments. Florida is another crypto-friendly state that is about to
                                accept crypto payments toward certain state taxes and Miami City is trying to become a
                                crypto-hub. As an honorable mention, Montana has no sales and use taxes and they passed
                                a law (30-10-105 MCA) to recognize crypto tokens (called utility tokens) and exempted
                                them from state securities since 2019.</p>
                            <p><br>Amoung all these crypto-friendly states, the clear winner for Marshall (Protonchain)
                                to host his First Blockchain Bank is either Texas or Wyoming. Both states already have
                                laws on the books for the legal status and protection of cryptocurrencies. Both states
                                also have crypto-friendly governors and legislators, and both states offer tax breaks or
                                incentives for crypto-services. Wyoming incentives include a cryptocurrency staking
                                program and advisory council; matching funds related to carbon capture, utilization and
                                storage projects; and the formation and management of DAOs (decentralized autonomous
                                organizations). Texas offers even better incentives; such as "10-year tax abatement,
                                sales tax credits and workforce training from the state” and crypto-friendly laws (like
                                Business and Commerce Codes-Chapter 12) to legally allow state-chartered banks to
                                provide clients with Virtual crypto-currencies custodial services simply by “filing a
                                financing [ID] statement” and showing “exclusive transfer control” or “shared”
                                possession with  private wallet keys held in escrow. (<a
                                    href="https://www.omm.com/resources/alerts-and-publications/alerts/texas-uniform-commercial-code-updated-to-recognize-cryptocurrency">source</a>:)
                            </p>
                            <p>But Wyoming can not compete with the Texas State Constitution (Article XVI, Section
                                16(c)) that insures Texas state-chartered banks are at least equal in powers, rights and
                                privileges to their federal counterparts, which may be better than federal banks in some
                                cases. "Of particular interest is a "super parity" provision which provides a framework
                                for a state bank chartered in Texas, upon application, to conduct any of the activities
                                allowed by any other insured state or federal financial institution in the nation...[so
                                this] dramatically increases Texas’ appeal as a central location from which to conduct
                                nationwide banking activities…[because] there is no "super parity" provision available
                                to national banks. (Section 32.010 of the Texas Finance Code)." <a
                                    href="https://www.dob.texas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Bank-Trust-Companies/charterbnk.pdf">https://www.dob.texas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Bank-Trust-Companies/charterbnk.pdf</a>
                                Thus, Texas generously giving state banks these expanded powers, higher legal lending
                                limits, and parity with national banks may be the best reasons of all for Protonchain to
                                charter their first Bank in Texas.</p>
                            <p><br>Perhaps these banking benefits help explain why, last December (2021), we saw part of

                                groundwork to open their First Blockchain Bank in Texas! Our bet is that Marshall has
                                already chosen his Bank location for the reasons above and added bonus of Texas being
