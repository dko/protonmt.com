                <p></p>
                <p><strong>MTL: the 1st token.</strong> It was recently discovered that Metallicus' CEO Marshall Hayner
                    has now minted a 6th token for a new blockchain called <a href="https://metalblockchain.org/">Metal
                        Chain</a>. But Hayner's first token MTL, was minted back in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain and
                    has a maximum supply of 65.6 Million tokens. That same year MTL was sold to investors, family and
                    friends to fund the development and launch of their crypto/payments exchange platform Metal Pay.
                </p>
                <p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/metal/historical-data/">historical trading
                        data</a>, the first time MTL was offered for sale on an exchange was July 9th 2017 where MTL
                    opened at $1.22 and closed the day at $1.67. Just two months later on Sept 7th MTL had already
                    peaked closing at ATL Â (all time high) of $13.53. MTL never reclaimed it's former glory. The
                    scuttlebut among some community members involved since those early days, is MTL's swift and
                    precipitious falling of price was due to selling pressure by early Metallicus VC investors cashing
                    out.</p>
                <p>After the Metal Pay launch, MTL was used as a rewards token with a portion of MTL going back to the
                    sender for every cash transaction. Metallicus called this rewards program PoPP (proof of processed
                    payment). For several years Metallicus widely marketed PoPP using public statements and marketing
                    materials which had the effect of giving assurances (implied or otherwise) to customers that
                    Metallicus had put aside a pool of 26,341,112 MTL [see figure 1.] for this purpose alone. </p>

                <p>Unfortunately, contrary to earlier assertions made, and to keep Metal Pay solvent and to pay
                    employees, this pool was dipped into, and that MTL was sold until there was no longer a pool. Note:

                <p> <strong>XPR: the 2nd token. </strong>Sometime around 2019 after an 18 month bear market, the market
                    was finally recovering and gas fees on Ethereum were again at their peak. The price of MTL already
                    cratered and with it dwindling demand for the token, the need still existed to pay Metallicus
                    employees and to keep Metal Pay solvent. Hence, Marshall likely needed another cash source. It was
                    around that time that Proton chain was born. Hayner cloned the newly released open source EOSIO
                    blockchain framework and began making changes to suit his idea for a new payments platform. </p>
                <p>Somewhere along the way in that same year, Marshall realized he needed the help of Fred Krueger. Fred
                    was the founder of the (also EOSIO based) <a
                        href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lynx-chain-whitepaper-01-fred-krueger?trk=pulse-article_more-articles_related-content-card">Lynx
                        blockchain </a>and creator of the highly successful EOS Lynx wallet. Hayner met with Fred and
                    the two of them agreed to combine forces to create what became known as the Proton blockchain. Like
                    MTL, XPR was first minted as an erc20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This choice was due in large
                    part to the need to raise funds to bootstrap development while the new wallet was being developed
                    and Proton chain was pieced together. </p>
                <p>As part of their agreement Fred was given the titles of Co-Founder of Proton and Chairman of Proton
                    Chain LLC and Metallicus absorbed the Lynx chain IP and Fred's team. After the launch of Proton's
                    mainnet, Fred, and his team together with the <a
                        href="https://blog.protonchain.com/protons-airdrop-information/">comminuty received the
                        airdropped XPR token</a>. LYNX holders received five separate drops at a 1:1 ratio and MTL
                    holders received a sinlge drop at 1:1 distribution ratio. It was from the codebase of Lynx, that
                    Proton inherited the simple @name structure like "@fred" for accounts, and other tech for the Proton
                    wallet.</p>
                <p>Fred was also responsible for creating the infamous longstaking architecture. Long staking on Proton
                    used an algorithm that compared the price of Bitcoin vs XPR over a period of 90-360 days.
                    Inevitibaly longstaking was gamed. It was easy. With XPR's low market cap and lower trading volume
                    it proved too simple to manipulate. Larger account holders could easily move the price/rewards
                    structure in their favor by selling and up to 10x return (in the form of XPR) at the end of whatever
                    chosen staking period. The failure to create or else spend the necessary funds for a succesful
                    marketing campaign contributed to an already stagnant price. This lack of momentum for XPR was often
                    publicly blamed on longstaking and especially Fred, it's creator. In a plot twist of irony, and not
                    well known, it was Fred who opposed the Metallicus owned XPR treasury (the largest holder of XPR)
                    from longstaking. Metallicus and Marshall profited the most from longstaking and Fred was repeatedly
                    and publicly used by Marshall as a scapegoat for the many ills of the chain, but especially the
                    stagnant price of the XPR token. </p>
                <p>Here is how the pattern seemingly unfolded: Each month near the time for Metallicus to make payroll,
                    Marshall (or else his agents) would transfer large sums of XPR from the XPR treasury (@xprtreasury),
                    to the on chain Metal payroll account (@metalpayroll) and finally to account to make the payroll for
                    Metallicus employees, and Metal Pay. This selling pressure would inevitably cause the price to fall.
                    Customers and communuty members would be diappointed, upset XPR wasn't performing and in order to
                    molify them and keep morale up, Marshall would appear on various social media platforms blaming
                    Fredblamed Â Fred was then demonised by Marshall who also encouraged others to publicly pile on.
                    Rinse and repeat. Â </p>
                <p><strong>XMT the 3rd </strong>XMT is MTL wrapped on the Proton chain. The original vision of XMT was
                    to be a governance token used to decide interest rates for lending and borrowing on the Proton
                    chain. It was to be part of a larger DeFI vision. <a

                        a reddit AMA last year </a>Marshall had the following to say about XMT: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>MTL, initially distributed through PoPP is evolving to encompass Metal Dollar (XMD), a
                        decentralized stablecoin on the Proton blockchain. XMT (MTL on Proton) is the governance token
                        which is used to determine: stablecoins allowed access to the pool, stablecoin allocation in the
                        pool, entry/exit fee cost in XMT, and future features of Metal Dollar (XMD). XMD is equivalent
                        1:1 to any stablecoin in the basket can be moved fluidly between other stablecoin (ie USDT to
                        USDC) this is similar to Curve Finance in some ways, but it is multichain through the xToken
                        bridge and provides interest to a basket stablecoin XMD.</p>

                <p>There was a discussion in the community with more than a few investors voicing concern about the
                    quantity of LOAN Metallicus and Marshall himself would personally receive. After the airdrop
                    Marshall ended up the second largest holder of LOAN after Metallicus owned accounts. The same is
                    still true today. Â </p>
                <p><strong>Which brings us back to the XMD the fifth token</strong>. XMD can be minted by sending XMT to
                    <a href="https://metaldollar.com/mint">Metaldollar.com</a>. While this platform was ony released
                    within the last couple of weeks, it seems very much at odds with the present and future direction as
                    we will soon discuss below.</p>
                <p><strong>Lastly there is the sixth token METAL</strong>; the governance and resource token of the
                    Metal blockcain. Marshall stated today mainnet is already live though there is no link to public
                    access. There also isn't a Github repo to look at any code. Moreover and most importantly METAL is
                    not yet for sale anywhere. The only way to get the METAL token is to send MTL/XMT to @metalchain (an
                    account address on the Proton chain). The distribution is 2:1. So for every 1 MTL token sent the
                    sender receives 2 METAL tokens. Keep in mind METAL has <strong>zero value</strong> and with no
                    promise or otherwise that it will ever be of any worth. METAL also has 10x supply of MTL/XMT further
                    diluting the value of the MTL token.</p>
                <p>This brings us to the steal. In my more than 6 years in the crypto space I have never even heard of
                    such a rediculous offer: give me your token that is worth $1.38 (as of now) and i'll give you 2 of
                    these worthless tokens! Even the craziest ICO's (and there were many) so prevalent in the earlier
                    days were never so bold as to have conceived of such a plan as now designed by Marshall and company
                    Metallicus. So many red flags. Let's concentrate on several here.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Give me your MTL token of value for my worthless METAL token. This idea is so insane that it is
                        hard to even take the offer seriously. Investors are in effect being asked to donate to the next
                        project so Marshall and team can turn around and sell your token and reap the rewards of your
                        investment. It's also likely illegal at least in the U.S. which brings us to red flag #2.</li>
                    <li>The U.S. is blocked from any participation. This is a red flag for several reasons, the first of
                        which it is totally out of left field from what we have come to expect from Marshall. For
                        several years now, Marshall has been known for being very pro U.S. and supportive of the
                        country's future regulatory framework. Proton with it's builtin KYC, DeID (decentralized ID) in
                        anticiaption of mandatory KYC laws. It was designed with this purpose in mind. He even worked
                        with legislators in an effort to help pass laws that were more crypto friendly. To now stray
                        outside of the normal behaviour of his public persona is very troubling. Â Essentially Marshall
                        is running an ICO with a twist and one that his legal counsel considers likely illegal in the
                        U.S.</li>
                    <li>Six tokens later, no real marketing has ever been done to promote Proton or significant effort
                        made to reach out to developers to grow Proton chain. The lack of partnerships and dearth of VC
                        funding is not a track record of leadership success. Hence what has failed in the past will
                        likely be repeated in the future.</li>
                    <li>The selling of tokens in order to keep the commercial Metal Pay app solvent depirves investors
                        of profit. For many years, Marshall's goto plan has been to sell XPR (the main token on Proton
                        chain) to keep his commercial venture Metal Pay solvent. This fact has been a sticking point
                        with alot of investors over the years; even prior to the advent of Proton chain, when MTL was
                        sold for the same reason. Every time XPR sees some increase in value Marshall and by extension
                        Metallicus sells to make payroll. This pattern of selling has sadly shortchanged the investors
                        and will more than likely continue onto whatever future scheme.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We hope from this post we have made clear our public stance on the conversion to METAL and the risks
                    involved. In our opinion it may very well be that what we are witnessing is a rugpull in slow
                    motion. It is nonetheless highly suspicious and strange and totally against the ethos of crypto to
                    proceed in the manner Marshall has. It also seems as though his plans are rushed and more recently
                    hatched then he has lead others to believe. We think there should have been a measured rollout with
                    plans shared with the communuty before the METAL token was minted and an airdrop to all MTL/XMT
                    holders.</p>
                <p>As Block Producers, we have always felt we had a duty first and foremost to the community, and voters
                    of the chain. That is why we have always sought to bring the truth as we have found it, without
                    spin; at whatever the personal or professional cost. Â  </p>
