But Hayner&apos;s first token MTL, was minted back in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain and has a maximum supply of 65.6 Million tokens. That same year MTL was sold to investors, family and friends to fund the development and launch of their crypto/payments exchange platform Metal Pay. </p><p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/metal/historical-data/">historical trading data</a>, the first time MTL was offered for sale on an exchange was July 9th 2017 where MTL opened at $1.22 and closed the day at $1.67. Just two months later on Sept 7th MTL had already peaked closing at ATL &#xA0;(all time high) of $13.53. MTL never reclaimed it&apos;s former glory. The scuttlebut among some community members involved since those early days, is MTL&apos;s swift and precipitious falling of price was due to selling pressure by early Metallicus VC investors cashing out.</p><p>After the Metal Pay launch, MTL was used as a rewards token with a portion of MTL going back to the sender for every cash transaction. Metallicus called this rewards program PoPP (proof of processed payment). For several years Metallicus widely marketed PoPP using public statements and marketing materials which had the effect of giving assurances (implied or otherwise) to customers that Metallicus had put aside a pool of 26,341,112 MTL [see figure 1.] for this purpose alone. </p><p>Figure 1.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://protonmt.com/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-31-at-10.21.20-AM-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="743" height="473" srcset="https://protonmt.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-31-at-10.21.20-AM-2.png 600w, https://protonmt.com/content/images/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-31-at-10.21.20-AM-2.png 743w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unfortunately, contrary to earlier assertions made, and to keep Metal Pay solvent and to pay employees, this pool was dipped into, and that MTL was sold until there was no longer a pool. Note: in a 2021, <a href="https://blog.metalpay.com/metalpay/sunsetting-popp-and-shifting-mtl-towards-defi/">blog post &#xA0;on the Metal Pay website, this PoPP &quot;experiment&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; as it was now considered was finally &quot;sunsetted.&quot; </a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://protonmt.com/content/images/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-01-at-1.26.22-AM-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="391" height="337"><figcaption>Marco, an early investor of MTL exposes how Metallicus &quot;emptied out PoPP pool&quot;</figcaption></figure><p> <strong>XPR: the 2nd token. </strong>Sometime around 2019 after an 18 month bear market, the market was finally recovering and gas fees on Ethereum were again at their peak. The price of MTL already cratered and with it dwindling demand for the token, the need still existed to pay Metallicus employees and to keep Metal Pay solvent. Hence, Marshall likely needed another cash source. It was around that time that Proton chain was born. Hayner cloned the newly released open source EOSIO blockchain framework and began making changes to suit his idea for a new payments platform. </p><p>Somewhere along the way in that same year, Marshall realized he needed the help of Fred Krueger. Fred was the founder of the (also EOSIO based) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lynx-chain-whitepaper-01-fred-krueger?trk=pulse-article_more-articles_related-content-card">Lynx blockchain </a>and creator of the highly successful EOS Lynx wallet. Hayner met with Fred and the two of them agreed to combine forces to create what became known as the Proton blockchain. Like MTL, XPR was first minted as an erc20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. This choice was due in large part to the need to raise funds to bootstrap development while the new wallet was being developed and Proton chain was pieced together. </p><p>As part of their agreement Fred was given the titles of Co-Founder of Proton and Chairman of Proton Chain LLC and Metallicus absorbed the Lynx chain IP and Fred&apos;s team. After the launch of Proton&apos;s mainnet, Fred, and his team together with the <a href="https://blog.protonchain.com/protons-airdrop-information/">comminuty received the airdropped XPR token</a>. LYNX holders received five separate drops at a 1:1 ratio and MTL holders received a sinlge drop at 1:1 distribution ratio. It was from the codebase of Lynx, that Proton inherited the simple @name structure like &quot;@fred&quot; for accounts, and other tech for the Proton wallet.</p><p>Fred was also responsible for creating the infamous longstaking architecture. Long staking on Proton used an algorithm that compared the price of Bitcoin vs XPR over a period of 90-360 days. Inevitibaly longstaking was gamed. It was easy. With XPR&apos;s low market cap and lower trading volume it proved too simple to manipulate. Larger account holders could easily move the price/rewards structure in their favor by selling and up to 10x return (in the form of XPR) at the end of whatever chosen staking period. The failure to create or else spend the necessary funds for a succesful marketing campaign contributed to an already stagnant price. This lack of momentum for XPR was often publicly blamed on longstaking and especially Fred, it&apos;s creator. In a plot twist of irony, and not well known, it was Fred who opposed the Metallicus owned XPR treasury (the largest holder of XPR) from longstaking. Metallicus and Marshall profited the most from longstaking and Fred was repeatedly and publicly used by Marshall as a scapegoat for the many ills of the chain, but especially the stagnant price of the XPR token. </p><p>Here is how the pattern seemingly unfolded: Each month near the time for Metallicus to make payroll, Marshall (or else his agents) would transfer large sums of XPR from the XPR treasury (@xprtreasury), to the on chain Metal payroll account (@metalpayroll) and finally to account to make the payroll for Metallicus employees, and Metal Pay. This selling pressure would inevitably cause the price to fall. Customers and communuty members would be diappointed, upset XPR wasn&apos;t performing and in order to molify them and keep morale up, Marshall would appear on various social media platforms blaming Fredblamed &#xA0;Fred was then demonised by Marshall who also encouraged others to publicly pile on. Rinse and repeat. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>XMT the 3rd </strong>XMT is MTL wrapped on the Proton chain. The original vision of XMT was to be a governance token used to decide interest rates for lending and borrowing on the Proton chain. It was to be part of a larger DeFI vision. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q5xztf/hey_rcryptocurrency_we_are_metal_a_company/">On a reddit AMA last year </a>Marshall had the following to say about XMT: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>MTL, initially distributed through PoPP is evolving to encompass Metal Dollar (XMD), a decentralized stablecoin on the Proton blockchain. XMT (MTL on Proton) is the governance token which is used to determine: stablecoins allowed access to the pool, stablecoin allocation in the pool, entry/exit fee cost in XMT, and future features of Metal Dollar (XMD). XMD is equivalent 1:1 to any stablecoin in the basket can be moved fluidly between other stablecoin (ie USDT to USDC) this is similar to Curve Finance in some ways, but it is multichain through the xToken bridge and provides interest to a basket stablecoin XMD.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For having such a supposedly important role, XMT is curiously absent from the <a href="https://metalblockchain.org">Metal blockchain lite-paper</a>.</p><p>LOAN, the fourth token and as it&apos;s name implies functions as a token that collateralizes loans on the <a href="https://protonloan.com">ProtonLend platform</a>. <a href="https://blog.protonchain.com/proton-lend-loan-airdrop-to-xpr-and-mtl-holders-stakers/">XPR holders received the LOAN token is the the follwing distribution:</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>333:1 XMT (known as MTL on Ethereum)</li>
<li>666:1 XMT liquidity pool Proton Swap</li>
<li>1:1 XPR unstaked</li>
<li>2:1 XPR short staked</li>
<li>2:1 XPR liquidity pool Proton Swap</li>
<li>10:1 XPR long staked 90 day</li>
<li>30:1 XPR long staked 365 day</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There was a discussion in the community with more than a few investors voicing concern about the quantity of LOAN Metallicus and Marshall himself would personally receive. After the airdrop Marshall ended up the second largest holder of LOAN after Metallicus owned accounts. The same is still true today. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Which brings us back to the XMD the fifth token</strong>. XMD can be minted by sending XMT to <a href="https://metaldollar.com/mint">Metaldollar.com</a>. While this platform was ony released within the last couple of weeks, it seems very much at odds with the present and future direction as we will soon discuss below.</p><p><strong>Lastly there is the sixth token METAL</strong>; the governance and resource token of the Metal blockcain. Marshall stated today mainnet is already live though there is no link to public access. There also isn&apos;t a Github repo to look at any code. Moreover and most importantly METAL is not yet for sale anywhere. The only way to get the METAL token is to send MTL/XMT to @metalchain (an account address on the Proton chain). The distribution is 2:1. So for every 1 MTL token sent the sender receives 2 METAL tokens. Keep in mind METAL has <strong>zero value</strong> and with no promise or otherwise that it will ever be of any worth. METAL also has 10x supply of MTL/XMT further diluting the value of the MTL token.</p><p>This brings us to the steal. In my more than 6 years in the crypto space I have never even heard of such a rediculous offer: give me your token that is worth $1.38 (as of now) and i&apos;ll give you 2 of these worthless tokens! Even the craziest ICO&apos;s (and there were many) so prevalent in the earlier days were never so bold as to have conceived of such a plan as now designed by Marshall and company Metallicus. So many red flags. Let&apos;s concentrate on several here.</p><ol><li>Give me your MTL token of value for my worthless METAL token. This idea is so insane that it is hard to even take the offer seriously. Investors are in effect being asked to donate to the next project so Marshall and team can turn around and sell your token and reap the rewards of your investment. It&apos;s also likely illegal at least in the U.S. which brings us to red flag #2.</li><li>The U.S. is blocked from any participation. This is a red flag for several reasons, the first of which it is totally out of left field from what we have come to expect from Marshall. For several years now, Marshall has been known for being very pro U.S. and supportive of the country&apos;s future regulatory framework. Proton with it&apos;s builtin KYC, DeID (decentralized ID) in anticiaption of mandatory KYC laws. It was designed with this purpose in mind. He even worked with legislators in an effort to help pass laws that were more crypto friendly. To now stray outside of the normal behaviour of his public persona is very troubling. &#xA0;Essentially Marshall is running an ICO with a twist and one that his legal counsel considers likely illegal in the U.S.</li><li>Six tokens later, no real marketing has ever been done to promote Proton or significant effort made to reach out to developers to grow Proton chain. The lack of partnerships and dearth of VC funding is not a track record of leadership success. Hence what has failed in the past will likely be repeated in the future.</li><li>The selling of tokens in order to keep the commercial Metal Pay app solvent depirves investors of profit. For many years, Marshall&apos;s goto plan has been to sell XPR (the main token on Proton chain) to keep his commercial venture Metal Pay solvent. This fact has been a sticking point with alot of investors over the years; even prior to the advent of Proton chain, when MTL was sold for the same reason. Every time XPR sees some increase in value Marshall and by extension Metallicus sells to make payroll. This pattern of selling has sadly shortchanged the investors and will more than likely continue onto whatever future scheme.</li></ol><p>We hope from this post we have made clear our public stance on the conversion to METAL and the risks involved. In our opinion it may very well be that what we are witnessing is a rugpull in slow motion. It is nonetheless highly suspicious and strange and totally against the ethos of crypto to proceed in the manner Marshall has. It also seems as though his plans are rushed and more recently hatched then he has lead others to believe. We think there should have been a measured rollout with plans shared with the communuty before the METAL token was minted and an airdrop to all MTL/XMT holders.</p><p>As Block Producers, we have always felt we had a duty first and foremost to the community, and voters of the chain. That is why we have always sought to bring the truth as we have found it, without spin; at whatever the personal or professional cost. &#xA0; </p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The views, opinions, positions or strategies expressed by the author(s) and those providing comments are theirs alone, and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions, positions or strategies of any company or any employee thereof.

The last major downturn was in 2017 when Bitcoin lost nearly half its value (from $19,783.06 to below $11,000) in just five days. By the time the volatile market fully recovered some 24 months later, many crypto projects had folded but others were just getting started. </p><p>Enter Proton Blockchain (not yet two years old) that already has a suite of products built around an amazing ecosystem; which includes the features of &#xA0;Web3 connectivity (WebAuth.com); cross blockchain swaps (ProtonSwap); yield farming (farming pools); and the latest addition&#x2013;ProtonLoan&#x2013;a completely trustless DeFi platform that enables the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrency all using Proton&apos;s uniquely efficient model of zero gas fees, combined with its own xtokens (wrapped versions of some of the most popular crypto currencies). To fully understand the end goal for Proton Blockchain, one needs to follow the recurring theme of the messaging used by Protonchain CEO Marshall Hayner on social media:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is why I am building First Blockchain &#x1F3E6;<br><br>Imagine a bank that not only tolerates cryptocurrency, but welcomes the amazing people and businesses growing the future of finance &#x269B;&#xFE0F;<br><br>It pays to be first &#x1F918; <a href="https://t.co/9B2Hgg4ZPv">https://t.co/9B2Hgg4ZPv</a></p>&#x2014; marshall.xpr &#x269B;&#xFE0F;,&#x1F918;,&#x1F91D; (@MarshallHayner) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarshallHayner/status/1485477589326053377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</figure><p>Instead of waiting for the perfect regulatory climate in which to launch a nationally chartered FDIC insured bank, the tweet above (on January 23, 2022) indicates that Marshall/Metallicus will likely apply for a SPDI license in a single state. Why? Because it will expedite the creation of a bank while they can still enjoy a first-mover advantage. Remember only FBB&amp;T can claim to have a bank that runs on their own blockchain (like Protonchain) and feature their own wrapped xtokens. There are many reasons why Protonchain&apos;s &#x201C;First Blockchain Bank&#x201D; &#xA0;will open next year and why choosing the right location matters.</p><p>This goal to be the First Blockchain Bank and Trust (FBB&amp;T) is the long game for Proton and Metal Pay owned by parent company Metallicus. Hayner is firmly at the helm of both enterprises synergized together through a series of updates and releases including: Proton(DeFI) + Metal Pay(fiat on/off ramp) + FBBT (full regluatory compliance/securities expemption) = the crpyto bank for the 21st century. But then came some setbacks. At Money 20/20 October 2021, @MarshallHayner&#x2013; the CEO of the Proton Blockchain and Metallicus announced that his team had applied then withdrawn their Federal banking charter application pending changes and guidance from Federal Banking Regulators. This plan for FBB&amp;T (on Protonchain) to become a full service national charter bank was delayed due in part to a regluatory cloud that formed with the incoming Biden administration. During this interim period, few new banks were formed, with none at the national level. Instead the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) acceptance has trended towards state licenced entities. </p><p>Since the Dodd-Frank Banking Regulations of 1997 were enacted, hundreds of national banks and federal savings banks across the United States have now converted to state charters. &#x201C;These banks typically cite three reasons for converting: cost savings and increased earnings, [improved] regulatory access and relationships, and the dilution (or disuse) of [restrictive] national bank powers.&#x201D; (<a href="https://www.bankdirector.com/issues/weighing-benefits-state-charter/">https://www.bankdirector.com/issues/weighing-benefits-state-charter/</a> ) &#xA0;The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Banking Act resulted in significant cutbacks and a reduction in the availability of federal preemption or having to comply with differing state laws. With the majority of national banks being community banks that do not actually operate nationally, this and favorable state laws now make State chartered Banks the best choice for many financial institutions. </p><p>However, in the absence of any specific Federal regulations on cryprocurrencies, thirty-three states and Puerto Rico have taken the lead to enact pending legislation for reviewing crypto regulations with another seventeen states having already enacted legislation to regulate or license digital currency (token) transmissions. Such state regulations cover 1) the use of cryptocurrencies as legal tender in business transactions (including taxation), 2) and/or impose regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges as money transmitters, 3) and define the legal the status of smart contracts and crypto-tokens. Here is a list of current or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/cryptocurrency-2021-legislation.aspx#:~:text=Thirty%2Dthree%20states%20and%20Puerto,blockchain%20and%20cryptocurrency%20study%20committee">pending crypto-legislation by state</a>. </p><p>So far, only a few states (like California, Wyoming, Florida, Texas, and Colorado) are considered crypto-friendly states to have adapted none of the restrictive commercial laws against blockchain innovation or else passed friendly digital asset regulations and licensing requirements. For instance, Wyoming is considered to have the one of the most crypto-friendly regulations in the United States; including tax breaks for crypto transactions; approval of two new crypto-bank charters ( Kraken Financial and Avanti); and over 20 laws that make it easier for crypto businesses to operate. Note: Although Wyoming is not FDIC insured for state banks, their SPDI (special-purpose depository institution) license provides banking oversight. But Texas does have FDIC insurance for state banks. And as a hub for Bitcoin miners, Texas in 2021 recognizes the legal status and protection of cryptocurrencies to pave the way for state banks to provide custody services for cryptocurrency and transmitter services.</p><p>In California, the Office of Financial Technology and Innovation will reportedly help create new crypto-specific rules to attract and encourage crypto-businesses and increase its 2,473 crypto ATMs. Colorado also passed great crypto-friendly laws and wants to allow for crypto tax payments. Florida is another crypto-friendly state that is about to accept crypto payments toward certain state taxes and Miami City is trying to become a crypto-hub. As an honorable mention, Montana has no sales and use taxes and they passed a law (30-10-105 MCA) to recognize crypto tokens (called utility tokens) and exempted them from state securities since 2019.</p><p><br>Amoung all these crypto-friendly states, the clear winner for Marshall (Protonchain) to host his First Blockchain Bank is either Texas or Wyoming. Both states already have laws on the books for the legal status and protection of cryptocurrencies. Both states also have crypto-friendly governors and legislators, and both states offer tax breaks or incentives for crypto-services. Wyoming incentives include a cryptocurrency staking program and advisory council; matching funds related to carbon capture, utilization and storage projects; and the formation and management of DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations). Texas offers even better incentives; such as &quot;10-year tax abatement, sales tax credits and workforce training from the state&#x201D; and crypto-friendly laws (like Business and Commerce Codes-Chapter 12) to legally allow state-chartered banks to provide clients with Virtual crypto-currencies custodial services simply by &#x201C;filing a financing [ID] statement&#x201D; and showing &#x201C;exclusive transfer control&#x201D; or &#x201C;shared&#x201D; possession with &#xA0;private wallet keys held in escrow. (<a href="https://www.omm.com/resources/alerts-and-publications/alerts/texas-uniform-commercial-code-updated-to-recognize-cryptocurrency">source</a>:)</p><p>But Wyoming can not compete with the Texas State Constitution (Article XVI, Section 16(c)) that insures Texas state-chartered banks are at least equal in powers, rights and privileges to their federal counterparts, which may be better than federal banks in some cases. &quot;Of particular interest is a &quot;super parity&quot; provision which provides a framework for a state bank chartered in Texas, upon application, to conduct any of the activities allowed by any other insured state or federal financial institution in the nation...[so this] dramatically increases Texas&#x2019; appeal as a central location from which to conduct nationwide banking activities&#x2026;[because] there is no &quot;super parity&quot; provision available to national banks. (Section 32.010 of the Texas Finance Code).&quot; <a href="https://www.dob.texas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Bank-Trust-Companies/charterbnk.pdf">https://www.dob.texas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Bank-Trust-Companies/charterbnk.pdf</a> Thus, Texas generously giving state banks these expanded powers, higher legal lending limits, and parity with national banks may be the best reasons of all for Protonchain to charter their first Bank in Texas.</p><p><br>Perhaps these banking benefits help explain why, last December (2021), we saw part of the Metallicus team join Marshall for a visit to the Texas capital. This visit for no apparent reason was made public a few days later by this photograph shared here in this tweet:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/15) Hi everyone thought I would write a little thread about what might be happening in Texas with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XPR&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XPR</a>!

</figure><p>What is certain is that sooner or later, Marshall will receive his first State Bank charter likely no later than 2023. But one has to wonder if Marshall and his Proton Blockchain were signaling in this tweet above that they have already been laying the groundwork to open their First Blockchain Bank in Texas! Our bet is that Marshall has already chosen his Bank location for the reasons above and added bonus of Texas being the 9th or 10th largest economy in the world! </p><p>The Protonchain team has recognized by future-proofing their blockchain with a Blockchain Bank they can merge traditional and decentralized finance unlocking banking access 24/7 for everyone, so that no one gets left behind!</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to import your Private Key to WebAuth.com wallet.]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a short but neccessary article on how to properly and securely import your key ino the new WebAuth.com wallet on IOS.

This installment features, Rylan Co-Founder of <a href="https://storex.io/">Storex</a>, the first e-commerce marketplace solution built on Proton.</em></blockquote><p> Storex is an open marketplace/crypto exchange whose products are warranted through decentralized escrow (using smart contracts). Hence, it is unlike any other marketplace we&apos;ve ever seen on eBay or Amazon. This is because Storex is built upon blockchain technology and uses Web 3.0 payment rails. Users of the Storex marketplace can buy or sell goods and services in exchange for a variety of cryptocurrencies. Storex is also the first company to announce integration with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webauth-com/id1594500069">WebAuth.com</a> on the <a href="https://www.protonchain.com/">Proton Blockchain</a>. </p><p>This past September, the Proton team released <a href="https://blog.protonchain.com/introducing-webauth-com-authentication-identity-and-payments-on-webauth-protocol/">WebAuth.com</a> (Web3) payments platform designed to make online purchases secured through biometrics and frictionless transactions using fiat to crypto on-ramps. (Note: in December, WebAuth.com. got an upgrade meant to encompass an entire suite of cross-platform tools, including: a mobile wallet on IOS and Android as well as a Web 3.0 experience accessed right in the browser.) Both the website and wallet also feature bridges to other blockchains including Binance (BEP20), Ethereum blockchain, together with Proton mainnet support. While Storex is on track to be the first to release their marketplace on WebAuth.com, it is features like these that will attract many more developers to build Web3 solutions on Protonchain.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong>: Hello and welcome Rylan (from Storex). I&apos;m really excited to have you for this interview.</p><p><strong>Rylan</strong>: Hi Dan, thank you for having me. I&#x2019;m looking forward to sharing our project with you [on this blog] and the Proton community.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong>: Your company has created quite a stir in the community since arriving on the scene. But Storex began on Ethereum in 2019. What were some of the reasons why you made the switch from Ethereum to Proton? Also, did you look at any other blockchains before choosing Proton?</p><p><strong>Rylan</strong>: We&#x2019;ve been very grateful for the reception our project has received since moving to Proton. But we originally created Storex on the Ethereum blockchain back when gas fees were a fraction of what they are today. We were mindful of the increasing gas fees during the latter stage of our development process and hoped ETH 2.0 would arrive soon. But after delays to the Ethereum upgrade, [we were forced] to choose between waiting for the upgrade or migrating to another blockchain. It was an extremely difficult decision to make, but our team decided to migrate elsewhere after consulting our community.</p><p>We considered migrating to Binance Smart Chain and other Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchains, but [we] had concerns about their gas fee models and the costs involved with bridging assets. One of our team members discovered Proton through Twitter and liked the platform enough to personally invest in XPR. After informing the rest of our team about Proton Chain, the solution to our problem became clear. <strong>[Proton&apos;s] zero fees were incredibly appealing to our project as we believe most of our transactions will involve low-value items.</strong> Very few people ... [are] willing to purchase goods or services on the marketplace if the transaction fee exceeds the value of the product. Proton&#x2019;s support for cross-chain assets was also incredibly useful; [because] we no longer needed to facilitate the bridging of assets ourselves [since] Proton intuitively does this for us. [Moreover,] Proton&#x2019;s focus towards payment processing ultimately drove us to migrate to Proton Chain, even [though] we had to re-create the blockchain code from scratch and heavily modify our back-end.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Can you talk a bit about how you plan to take advantage of the Web3.0 technology stack of WebAuth.com and Protonswap.com (decentralized exchange on Proton Chain) for your e-commerce platform?</p><p><strong>Rylan</strong>: The Web3 technologies provided by the Proton team are very useful to Storex, [because] users on the marketplace can integrate their Proton wallet with their Storex account via the Proton Wallet app or WebAuth.com. This allows users to approve transactions on the blockchain throughout the Storex platform; [which] includes the creation of listings, and the purchase of goods and services.</p><p>As for ProtonSwap, it will allow our [Storex] users to quickly convert their assets as needed. [ProtonSwap also allows] merchants on our platform to choose which cryptocurrencies they accept as payment. So in the event the buyer does not hold any of the accepted cryptocurrencies, they can quickly use ProtonSwap to convert [their] assets.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong>: On a recent AMA (ask me anything) <a href="https://storex.medium.com/here-is-every-question-and-answer-from-our-recent-ama-1aca23971fe2?source=user_profile---------0-------------------------------">Q&amp;A held on Twitter</a>, you shared plans to use Amazon&apos;s infrastructure for customer deliveries. Can you explain how that will work?</p><p><strong>Rylan</strong>: We did mention on our Twitter AMA that Amazon provides a service called Amazon Shipping; which allows third-party websites to deliver packages through their own delivery infrastructure. This would be useful to a project of our size since we can fulfill many orders with Amazon&#x2019;s next day delivery. We are looking into making this service available for all of our merchants, rather than just the official Storex storefront.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>The ability for sellers to have their own custom storefronts is really next level stuff. Kind of like Shopify for crypto. Would you agree?</p><p><strong>Rylan: </strong>Yeah! We are trying to offer as much customization to the merchants [storefront owners] without detracting from the general theme of the [Storex] website. Merchants can create and customize their own storefronts on the [Storex] marketplace. We also decided to give sellers the ability to arrange the layout of their storefront [utilizing] featured listings displayed at the top. Customization options also extend to color palettes and branding. A template system will facilitate all of these features in a future update that allows community submitted templates to be implemented (by a voting system).</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> How will you ensure that customers will receive what they order. Will payments be held in escrow via smart contract (on the Proton blockchain) until delivery?</p><p><strong>Rylan: </strong>Yes, <strong>Storex will provide decentralized smart contracts for buyers and sellers who want to make use of them</strong>. This escrow service will only release the funds when the buyer confirms receipt of the goods; or there is inaction from the buyer after a certain amount of time; or else a dispute has been resolved through the resolution centre by community arbiters. Sellers choose the terms of a sale. But, it will be clearly displayed on the listing if the seller requires payment via our escrow service &#x2013;an optional feature.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I&apos;m not sure that &quot;caveat emptor&quot; and &quot;DYOR&quot; will be sufficient to gain and to keep the public trust. You must have faced some challenges in making sure Storex marketplace operates as permission-less as possible within framework of an e-commerce platform. </p><p><strong>Rylan: </strong>Absolutely! Having the entire process as decentralized as possible, without negatively affecting the user experience, is the main objective. We are mindful of our legal obligations, including removing illegal goods from our databases and responding to cease and desist notices. However, we have no control over the data on the blockchain. So, it is impossible for us to fully remove listings as they will still be persistent* on the blockchain (but not accessible via our user-interface). </p><p>(*Note: These blockchain listings will remain fully inter-actable and can make use of our escrow smart-contract. So it will be very interesting to see how these smart-contracts are used outside the scope of our website. I believe this quasi-decentralized e-commerce model will be the best alternative to centralized commerce without straying too far from regulatory obligations and consumer trust.)</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Which crypto currencies will Storex support?</p><p><strong>Rylan: Storex will support <a href="https://www.protonscan.io/tokens/STRX-proton-storex">STRX</a>, XPR, LOAN, and every xToken available on the Proton Chain.</strong> The list of supported cryptocurrencies will grow as more cross-chain assets are implemented onto the blockchain. The possibility for supporting custom tokens also exists depending on community consensus.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>STRX is the native token for your platform. Please talk a bit about the tokenomics of STRX.</p><p><strong>Rylan: </strong>STRX is the native token on the marketplace with a maximum total supply of 2 billion initially distributed via airdrops on Ethereum. We created a conversion tool which allows STRX holders on Ethereum to convert their tokens without paying gas fees. This does require holders to actively convert their tokens, (meaning there will likely be unclaimed tokens as people forget about projects or lose access to wallets). Any tokens not claimed by April 2022 will be airdropped back into the Proton community. The STRX token itself will have a number of uses including:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>natively supported payment method;</li>
<li>3% cashback; promoting listings and storefronts will also be payable in STRX;</li>
<li>KYC-verified users can stake STRX to gain eligibility to arbitrate disputes between buyers and sellers;</li>
<li>and digital vouchers can be created with STRX for use during the checkout process (users can gift vouchers to friends/family or those without a Proton wallet).</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Dan: </strong> Are there any regulatory hurdles to offering a 3% cash-back rewards program?</p><p><strong>Rylan: </strong>In the United Kingdom, security tokens are subject to financial regulation. Exchange tokens and utility tokens are not. STRX will fall within the latter categories, providing both utility and an exchange of value. The cash-back reward merely reimburses some of the exchange value, and provides no additional investment rights.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>When will the Storex platform be live?</p><p><strong>Rylan</strong>: I wish I could give you a precise date...[but] I can assure you that we are working as quickly as possible to release the marketplace without compromising security or quality.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Thank you for sharing with us your very innovative project on the Proton Chain. In closing, do you have anything you would like to add?</p><p><strong>Rylan</strong>: Thank you, Dan for giving me the opportunity to talk about the <a href="https://storex.io/index#faq">Storex platform.</a> We are incredibly grateful for the support from the Proton community since we announced our migration. We haven&#x2019;t encountered a community as helpful and enthusiastic as this one, and we look forward to developing more within the Proton ecosystem. We will be distributing more <a href="https://www.protonscan.io/tokens/STRX-proton-storex">STRX </a>tokens via giveaways and airdrops on our Twitter page, so stay tuned.</p><p>Contact Storex: <a href="Storex.io">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/storex_">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/HkVaF0O57btIzpGXLY8W6Q">Telegram</a>: </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Come Help Build the ProtonVerse]]></title><description><![CDATA[<blockquote><strong>The call is going out to the community to be a part of the creation of ProtonVerse (a metaverse) on Protonchain.

Advisory board members are needed to help guide the creation and growth of Protonchain.</strong></blockquote><img src="https://protonmt.com/content/images/2021/12/ProVArticle.png" alt="Come Help Build the ProtonVerse"><p> 	The metaverses of tomorrow will likey be accessable via the internet for everyone to share using augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), &#xA0;3d virtual world imagery similar to the movie called &#x201C;Ready Player One.&#x201D; Even though Facebook (meta) and others are creating their own version of the metaverse, this does not mean that the general public has to wait and see how they can be a part of the meta-verse future. For instance, ProtonVerse is planning to help you secure and store your precious digital assets. <strong>We also want you to be part of the ProtonVerse (metaverse) creation now. How?</strong></p><p><strong>	We are asking all interested parties to request to join the new ProtonVerse Advisory Board</strong> by sending a DM to the twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/protonverse">@ProtonVerse</a>. If you just want to help design the ProtonVerse, but do not want to be on the advisory board, then we will have a website suggestion box as part of the ProtonVerse website launch by January 2022.</p><p>	This new advisory Board is a critical first step to having a truly open public metaverse.<strong> </strong>The only criteria for ProtonVerse (metaverse) is that it be a family-friendly open metaverse. Yes, in answer to those who have asked, there will be a <strong>ProtonVerse coin</strong>. We are also excited about announcing that the ProtonVerse <strong>non-profit 501(c)(3)</strong> will be ready next week for all who want to invest early in the ProtonVerse metaverse as a tax-deductible investment. This allows ProtonVerse to be a free and open metaverse for everyone (no monthly fees); even if you just want to look around or earn money by play2earn games and tasks. Yes, FREE to join! Of course, family friendly corporate and private advertisers and investors will also be welcome to advertise for a reasonable tax-deductible fee.</p><p><strong>	But the main goal of #ProtonVerse is to be an open metaverse that streams metadata efficiently while protecting your digital assets-like NFTs, gaming assets, designs (using watermarks and metadata licensing terms embedded in your digital assets) all stored at secure locations on Blockchain super-nodes.</strong></p><p>	ProtonVerse is planning to help secure and store your precious digital assets on tiered super node(s) and decentralized computers interconnected to a system of open metaverse applications, experiences, and digital goods on Protonchain. The technology is already available through a combination of storage, blockchain technology and decentralized oracles. One of the best ways you can help protect your digital assets will be to place them on the ProtonVerse starting in 2022. A priority for the ProtonVerse is to first open an NFT gallery/marketplace for the purpose of securing your digital assets. As time goes on, the industry will get better at protecting talented individuals and their works. But there&#x2019;s one thing that artists can do now to protect themselves from copyright infringement. For instance, mint NFTs with a watermark. You can also set out licensing terms in the (meta-data) description for your non-fungible token (NFTs). More importantly, you can soon add unlockable content with a high-resolution, watermark-free copy that the buyer can receive upon purchasing a ProtonVerse token. Thus, creators will be able to take all of their digital assets with them into ProtonVerse and other metaverses in the future.</p><p>	Besides being able to help securely store your NFT&#x2019;s on the ProtonVerse, everyone will be able to interact with others within this virtual environment, with free and purchased virtual lands; securely buy &amp; sell your NFT art, avatar designs, gaming 3D assets, and more. Copyrights, trademarks, and internet domain names have also been registered/purchased to offer the public a place to create your own individual communities within ProtonVerse with little technical skills. These ProtonVerse communities will include a gaming community with cross-platform gaming; a dating community; a Proton fantasy island; virtual shops and stores; NFT galleries; education and spiritual communities; commercial for-profit &amp; non-profit corporation islands; and just about any other possible community that is family friendly can be created by anyone!</p><p>	In closing, you will be able to connect your Protonchain wallets (having fiat integration soon) to bring you a truly open metaverse experience using many currencies. Plus, with the Proton blockchain DeFi/bank custodians and partnerships that they are developing, we may be able to share these benefits in new and exciting ways on the ProtonVerse. We look forward to working with all #Protonchain supporters to help implement these goals and to grow your investments on this Protonchain. For this endeavor, ProtonVerse Corporation is actively seeking to hire Web3 engineers and programmers. All serious inquiries, please DM us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/protonverse">@ProtonVerse</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Big Cats on Proton with Carole Baskin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Fluctuations in ETH...make it hard to plan a release [&] no profit...[on Ethereum] for the cats when fees are high.

Carole has courageously taken a stand against an entire big cat industry that profits from their abuse and harm. Carole&apos;s rise to international fame began after appearing on Netflix&apos;s popular 2020 miniseries &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_King">Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness</a>.&quot; Carole played the rival and foil of Joe Exotic&#x2013;the main character; and she opposed and brought public outcry for the manner in which Joe treated his animals (at his formerly owned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Wynnewood_Exotic_Animal_Park">G.W. Zoo</a>) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynnewood,_Oklahoma">Wynnewood, Oklahoma</a>. Their years-long battle culminated in the felony conviction and 22-year sentence of Joe for trying to arrange a murder for hire to assassinate Carole and for the killing and mistreatment of his animals. Carole was later awarded control over Joe&apos;s G.W. Zoo and property to satisfy a trademark dispute and legal settlement. More recently, Carole sold this property with the stipulation that it not be used as a zoo for 100 years. </p><p>	But viewers of the show only saw what the Tiger King producers wanted them to see. They missed the thoughtful, empathetic, and caring Carole; who is also a very intelligent and forward-thinking person. And with her millions of followers spread out over social media, Carole&apos;s Big Cat Rescue is now becoming well known for their own original cryptocurrency called $CAT, as well as NFTs, minted on OpenSea, Foundation.app, and now the Proton Blockchain.</p><p><strong>	Dan: </strong>Hello, welcome, and thank you for taking time out to be here and for sharing your passion with us for big cat conservation and crypto.</p><p><strong>	Carole: </strong>Thanks for the &quot;op-purr-tunity&quot; to talk about what is important [big cats and crypto]. Too many people just want to rehash the Netflix series. But it totally missed the point that we will lose the tiger in the wild in the next five years if we don&#x2019;t end the practice of keeping them captive. I just can&#x2019;t imagine a world without tigers, lions, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, and other exotic cats, can you?</p><p><strong>	Dan: </strong>No! That would be terrible! Before we get to talking about crypto: in preparation for this interview, I learned some shocking facts about private and commercial ownership of big cats. There are more big cats in the U.S. privately-owned than there are in the wild. Only five U.S.A. states (Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Hawaii, and Louisiana) have a total ban on possession; and four states (Nevada Wisconsin, Alabama, and North Carolina) have no laws to prevent owning big cats. The rest of the states require a permit for individuals and commercial exotic cat exhibitors. Your activism and the work for your non-profit Big Cat Rescue have helped give rise to legislation called the <a href="https://awionline.org/legislation/big-cat-public-safety-act">Big Cat Public Safety Act</a> that would end cub handling and phase out future private ownership of big cats. Do you think this legislation goes far enough to protect these animals from harmful abuse?</p><p><strong>	Carole: </strong>By prohibiting cub handling [through this Act], it turns off the faucet of discarded cats [getting] into private hands. The bill [also] lets current owners keep the cats they have [if they] register them so law enforcement knows where they are. [The Act also] prohibits private owners from buying, breeding, or acquiring more [big cats]. Most private owners don&#x2019;t keep their big cats past the age of maturity, which is around 18 months to five years. So the problem will die out in a short period of time as those cats are transferred to legitimate sanctuaries that do not buy, breed, sell or allow public contact. Cub petting accounts for more than 95% of the big cat cubs who are bred; ripped from their mothers at birth; passed around as pay to play props; then killed, discarded, or just disappear when the exotic cats get to be about 12-16 weeks old. That&#x2019;s [the age] when they can take a finger off a child and become a liability instead of a moneymaker. In time, the sanctuaries, like mine [BCR], won&#x2019;t be needed and we can redirect our efforts to saving big cats, in the wild, where they belong in the first place. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Way back in 2018, you bought your first NFTs called <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co">CryptoKitties</a>. You&apos;ve also minted NFTs on <a href="https://opensea.io">OpenSea </a>and <a href="https://foundation.app">Foundation.app</a> on Ethereum blockchain. However more recently, you minted your <a href="https://bigcatrescue.org/big-cat-nfts/">Big Cat Rescue NFTs</a> on the <a href="https://protonchain.com">Proton Blockchain</a>. What are some of the reasons why you decided to create your latest NFT series on the Proton chain, and what advantages do you think Proton has over Ethereum? </p><p><strong>	Carole: </strong>Some things, like banking, may need the security of the extensive mainnet systems. Proton&#x2019;s blockchain offers a distinct advantage by not having the associated gas fees required for the mainnet. [Note: Metallicus&#x2013;the parent company of the Proton Foundation&#x2013;has proposed using Proton Blockchain for a bank called First Blockchain Bank &amp; Trust].</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Do you plan to release more NFTs on Proton Blockchain?</p><p><strong>Carole: </strong>Yes! Fluctuations in ETH activity make it hard to plan a release, because there is no profit to be made [on Ethereum] for the cats when fees are high. Proton Market has proven to be a financially viable alternative to these more expensive NFT markets that require such huge gas fees for minting, listing, and selling NFTs.</p><p><strong>	Dan: </strong>Big Cat Rescue has its token $CAT (you created) on <a href="https://rally.io">Rally.io</a>. What are some of the ways you have used this token, and have you considered creating a $CAT token on the Proton chain? It could be wrapped as an xtoken called XCAT. This way users of $CAT can take advantage of zero fees and the faster transaction speed on Proton Blockchain.</p><p><strong>	Carole: </strong>It sounds like<strong> </strong>wrapping $CAT for Proton Blockchain may be worth considering for the future. I&#x2019;m currently using $CAT (and yes, I know that reads like scat; which is something some people say to feral cats and another name for cat poo,) as a way to reward fans for making the &quot;<a href="https://bigcatrescue.org/cta-call-wild/">Call of the Wild</a>&quot; (a call to Congress in support of &#xA0;<a href="https://bigcatact.com">BigCatAct.com</a>) and sharing our message that big cats don&#x2019;t belong in cages. Over time, I can see [$CAT] or something like it becoming the subscription token for the live camera feeds.</p><p><strong>	Dan: </strong>The Covid lockdowns of 2020 caused many people to have to reorder their lives. None were more affected than the millions of small business owners who no longer had employees coming to work or else were forced to shut down, and thereby they suffered huge losses of revenue. Besides raising funds for BCR with sales of NFTs and your $CAT cryptocurrency, what are some other adjustments you have had to make to recoup your financial losses at BCR due to Covid?</p><p><strong>	Carole: </strong>I&#x2019;ve done a number of things to augment our income so that we can keep battling to end the abuse of big cats through better laws. Those things include the fees paid to me for Dancing With The Stars; some licensing deals for bobbleheads and <a href="https://youtooz.com/search?q=carole+baskin">YouTooz</a> (collectables); <a href="https://tread365.com/cool-cats/">animal-print face masks</a> [<a href="https://big-cat-rescue.myshopify.com/products/mask-big-cat-rescue-washable-face-mask-3-pack?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b95e95438&amp;_ss=r">BCR Shopif</a>y] and my appearances in cameos and memmo&#x2019;s (celebrity video messages) I do for a fee. We have cut back everything that isn&#x2019;t mission-critical, to make sure that if these variants keep turning our world upside down, the cats are safe for the rest of their lives.</p><p><strong>	Dan: </strong>Big Cat Rescue is still not open to the public and so still missing the revenue public tours previously brought in. Yet on your <a href="https://bigcatrescue.org/earth/">website</a>, you&apos;ve come up with a novel new model of using 360&#xBA; virtual worlds to bring attention to the plight of these amazing creatures and to educate the public to the conservancy of them. What made you think of using these videos and VR (virtual reality) to allow the public to view and interact with big cats, and how do you see blockchain technology advancing your conservancy goals? </p><p><strong>	Carole:</strong> Imagine a network of linked cameras around the world, (much like Explore.org&#x2019;s webcams), where the [big cat] stream is monetized. The viewers with headsets, or smartphones, can subscribe to the feeds through an NFT and the blockchain automatically distributes the funds to local people who live in regions populated by wild cats. This [can] make everyone in the community a game warden to ensure the safety of the animals and integrity of the ecosystem; [especialy] because their livelihood is directly linked to their success. For people who can&#x2019;t afford a headset or subscription fees, their local zoos can transform from pitiful [animal] prisons to location-based experiences that are educational, thus providing the conservation goals zoos claim to care about.</p><p>	Since 2010, we have had live streaming cameras on our cats. As that tech improved, we&#x2019;ve added more cameras with a goal of having around 50 cameras on our 50+ cats. Iconic Engine says they already have 360 degree, Internet streaming cameras available, so we are very close to being able to organize these feeds. Also after rehabbing bobcats, [we] re-release the wild-born bobcats back to the wild, [&amp;] often set up trail cams. All of these experiences have led us to the fact that people LOVE to watch wild cats doing what they do when they think no one is watching. We&#x2019;ve all seen camera trap footage in the form of black and white photos and videos. But now, that&#x2019;s available in color and in real-time via [free] internet streaming on our <a href="https://bigcatrescue.org/category/videos/">website</a>. </p><p><strong>	Dan: </strong>Thank you again for this interview. You are truly a hero to so many people, and I think you are also a hero to the magnificent creatures you have saved from untold suffering. In closing, do you have anything you would like to add for our readers?</p><p><strong>	Carole: </strong>I don&#x2019;t need to be the person who brings this vision into reality. I hope someone really smart adopts this idea [VR and Blockchain for big cat consevancy] as their own and makes themselves rich while saving the planet.</p><p>(Amazon will donate .5% of every dollar you spend to Big Cat Rescue AT NO COST TO YOU!

The $Freeos token is earned by completing various tasks: such as online surveys; voting concerning matters such as governance; determining percentage rates of inflation; and token burn fees. To kick start the Freeos economy, they launched a series of airdrops or AirClaim(s) (as Freeos calls it), which is being sent to the Proton account of anyone who joins AirClaim on their <a href="https://freeos.io">website</a>.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Hello, Jerome! I&apos;m really excited to have you here on Proton MT to feature your company and project Freeos. How did you come up with the idea for Freeos?</p><p><strong>Jerome K: </strong>Hi Dan! It&apos;s fantastic to be here, and I have to say I&#x2019;m impressed with the support you are providing to the ecosystem. The concept of a democratically-run economic system originated from an idea that simply popped into my mind in March 2018. [This was] not long after I had done some early development tutorials for Ethereum. My subconscious seemed to be mulling over ideas that would fit the unique characteristics of blockchain. Around this time, I was also thinking about the upcoming EOS platform and the advantages that it could bring [to Freeos]. The democratic aspects of DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) and the early focus on governance made EOS seem like a perfect fit [for us]. </p><p>Since this new concept was providing access to tokens for governance, it seemed like a new take on Universal Basic Income. But [this] income was conditioned upon some economic stewardship. The financial freedom aspect of this project also made us think of &#x201C;free&#x201D; (as in freedom + EOS). Thus the name &#x201C;Freeos&#x201D; was born. </p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>What made your Freeos group decide to use the Proton blockchain instead of the EOS blockchain?</p><p><strong>Jerome: </strong>We decided against EOS + Liquidapps because we didn&#x2019;t want to add additional layers of complexity that might break down or require support: including auditing complexity, points of failure, and any bugs. We liked WAX&#x2019;s ecosystem and Cloud Wallet, but we felt [WAX] didn&#x2019;t have enough security for countering Sybil Attacks.</p><p>This led us to focus more on Proton. We were very impressed by the way the Proton wallet improved upon the Anchor wallet experience for DApp integration; provided free accounts for users; and [it] has KYC built-in (for some jurisdictions). &#xA0;The [Proton] team is also extremely strong technically and fast in their development progress. The connection with Metal Pay [also] helped assure us that exchanges and access to stablecoins and wrapped tokens would be well underway.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>I noticed Freeos also has a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) component called &quot;FreeDAO.&quot; What is the tokenomics behind it?</p><p><strong>Jerome K: </strong>Freeos is a project of FreeDAO that is intended to be one of many projects centered around digital commons and tools of cooperation and freedom. &#xA0;We decided to focus on the economic tool first to help fund future projects and provide economic freedom. FreeDAO [also] receives an additional 7% of the mint after the AirClaim [airdrop is] completed.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>How critical is the crowdsourcing model of governance for UBI (Universal Basic Income) in your Freeos model?</p><p><strong>Jerome K: </strong>The wisdom-of-the-crowd aspect of Freeos is the core idea of the entire [Freeos] economic system. We liken Freeos to a UBI simply because we intend Freeos to have fairly light conditions [or little requirements] to receive an equitable income. People are becoming familiar with what is a UBI. So, it is an easier way to help explain what Freeos can do for people; [which is to] provide an ongoing, sustainable stream that can supplement people&#x2019;s income.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>I really like the notion of rewarding online user participation via surveys. But you&apos;ve taken it a step further with Freeos and built a live survey model (into the Freeos governance structure) as a means to get participants&apos; opinions and for stakeholders to vote. What controls, if any, are in place to prevent people from voting multiple times with different accounts and skewing the results? </p><p><strong>Jerome K: </strong>We do see this model as being a way to help prevent game-theory style &#x201C;Prisoner Dilemma&#x201D; dynamics from playing out [here]. The surveys and dashboard results can help align the community towards a relevant and consensual economic goal&#x2013;each and every week. We rely on the KYC aspect of the Proton chain to ensure there aren&#x2019;t any Sybil Attacks on the network by members using multiple accounts.<br><br>We are also looking into more decentralized methods of verifying uniqueness and have already created hooks for a potential solution. This can be useful for countries where Proton is unable to verify users via their KYC solutions.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Please talk a bit about the concept of using a self-managed economy to self-regulate towards a healthy equilibrium. What does this mean?</p><p><strong>Jerome K: </strong>Once the Governance Phase begins (after the AirClaim), the participants are fully running the economic parameters. They are on the frontlines earning income through their economic stewardship. Of course, each person is motivated by their own self-interest to varying degrees. But the system has been designed around incentives that are intended to keep the price stable, consistent, and regular.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>It has been a great pleasure having you here on this blog. Do you have something you would like to add that was not covered here or any closing comments you would like to give us?</p><p><strong>Jerome K: </strong>The pleasure is all mine. I really appreciate you taking the time to give our [Freeos] project a moment in the sun, and we appreciate your efforts in serving the Proton ecosystem.<br>I&#x2019;d like to take this opportunity to thank our growing community and subscribers for their patience and support. We had intended and hoped to launch the AirClaim [by now]. [But] extra engineering [was necessary] to help make the system modular [in order] to support future features in the Governance Phase. Extra attention has also been put into security [to ensure] this system starts on a strong foundation. We&#x2019;re excited and a bit impatient ourselves to have this launched, and so we fully appreciate [everyones&apos;] patience.<br><br>If you are curious to see how the AirClaim airdrop Phase initiates the Freeos system, please join <a href="http://www.freeos.io/">www.freeos.io</a>.

This installment features Matt Conn, the Founder of SLAMchain DAO on Proton.</blockquote><img src="https://protonmt.com/content/images/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-29-at-11.40.15-PM.png" alt="Power to the Creators: SLAMChain DAO"><p>This season has seen a plethora of meme coins materialize&#x2013;almost overnight&#x2013;in imitation of Doge, the original meme coin. One might be forgiven for writing off SLAMChain DAO and the wrestling token $SLAM as just another crypto meme. For instance, a recent SLAMChain contest awarded a prize of 1,000,000 $SLAM tokens to a single Proton account holder who correctly guessed the winner of all featured wrestling matches. Participants excitedly cheered on the action as it unfolded in a live watch party. But strip away all that fun, and underneath is some serious business too.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Welcome Matt; I&apos;ve been anticipating this sitdown with you for quite a while. I found myself transfixed while watching the wrestling matches that took place during the recent contest/watch party. I&apos;m not even a fan&#x2013;or at least I wasn&apos;t until that moment. Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but crypto is more of a recent foray for you isn&apos;t it? </p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Hi Dan! Yes and no to [the question] if I&#x2019;m new to the crypto world. I actually have been involved in crypto since the formation of Dogecoin! Way back in, I (believe) 2013, I started attending the Doge hackathon events. [That is] where I met Marshall and Jackson and all the OGs of the Dogecoin world and got involved a bit there.</p><p>At that time, I was running a convention as well as developing a video game; and there weren&#x2019;t really games being built on-chain then. So, while I loved the Dogecoin community and vibe, I wasn&#x2019;t really <em>involved</em> in making products or developing on-chain. Only in the past year or so have I really had my eyes opened to the idea that crypto and blockchain are so much more than just a replacement for physical currency; and [it adds] to all the opportunities that DeFi and blockchain can provide to games, DAOs, and so much more.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>You began in the industry as a game developer, right? </p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I actually originally started in music-tech. I worked at a company called BandPage, and we had, for a little while, a top 10 app on Facebook with over 30 million MAU (Monthly Active Users). [By] working there, I gained the confidence to be able to create my own game studio and [gaming] convention and cut my teeth on publishing a few games. I&#x2019;ve had the honor of being able to work on both Indie titles (where I could really get super weird and build from the ground up) and publishing multi-million dollar titles that required a bit more planning and careful steering of the ship&#x2013;like ToeJam &amp; Earl in 2019.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Wrestling and games aren&apos;t as dissimilar as one might think. They both involve their own unique kind of gamification if you will. What drew you to combine the two&#x2013;gaming with wrestling, and how does crypto fit into this picture?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I just like to work on projects that fit alongside my hobbies. I love wrestling and gaming. If there&#x2019;s a way to combine those things, as well as my interest in blockchain, [then] I think this really allows me to do something that feels less like a job and more like a passion. In general, I think crypto is very dry and focused only on profits and losses. I&#x2019;m hoping that, by injecting gaming-fun and wrestling attitude, we can make crypto way more fun and interesting to people who just wanna play and are not looking at it as an investment vehicle.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Let&apos;s talk a bit about your plans to utilize the $SLAM token in the promotion of live and streaming events. How can wrestling organizations and event planners use $SLAM? &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>My goal with $SLAM is (in part) to [demonstrate] reasons why people would want to watch together, and [show] ways that performers can add something fun to their offerings. By giving $SLAM away to promoters and wrestlers, and allowing them to give them away to their viewers, we hope that we can give them a fun souvenir, and something that they can give away to people who engage with their products. In the past, if someone was a super-fan, you could maybe send them a shirt, or a 8x10 signed photo. But [today], sending $SLAM is so easy and instantaneous. And with no shipping [needed], it really helps scale-up being able to reward people easily.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Explain the purpose of the $SLAM DAO Vault.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I strongly believe we&#x2019;ll see games and apps similar to NBA Top Shots as WWE (Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment), AEW (All Elite Wrestling), and [other] wrestling organizations begin to understand the power of NFTs and blockchain. I want the SLAM DAO Vault to be ready on day one to collect genesis [NFT] drops from these organizations; and be positioned to be the leading collector of professional wrestling and (potentially) other types of combat sports, NFTs, and digital collectibles. With a DAO, users can be a part of a vault that might have highly desirable NFTs that might otherwise be unapproachable as an individual collector; and (as a team) we can really grab some rare and unique items.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Readers should be aware that the website, <a href="https://www.slam.money">SLAM.money</a> has a faucet that distributes 500 $SLAM every 6 hours and also a slot machine DApp (Decentralized Application). Do you have any other DApps planned?</p><p> <strong>Matt:<strong> </strong></strong>SLAM Slots was sort of a proof-of-concept. Unfortunately, it was made in a way that had a pretty serious vulnerability. So, we took it down, for now, until we can launch a safer V2 version. Also, we do have another game planned&#x2013;SLAM Land, which will be a mix of roster building, land development, and hopefully a rewarding DeFi experience.</p><p><strong>Dan: </strong>Thanks for being here today. Its been fun! I&#x2019;d like to invite you back soon to tell us about your other venture on Proton&#x2013;$VLA (a land ownership and game token). Do you have anything else you would like to add that we didn&#x2019;t cover?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I&#x2019;m really excited about the possibilities of games and services that use Proton natively. It&apos;s fast [and] allows for fee-free transactions. I&#x2019;m [also] excited about where Proton will be in the coming months, as these DApps begin to get built out. Thank you so much for having me, and I think my closing [comment] to readers is this: consider what you could build on Proton. Building a DApp or token is accessible with all the documentation online, and purchasing resources is at the lowest cost ever. I want to see what <em>you</em> build on Proton! Also, please consider following @SlamChainDao and @VirtualLandDao on Twitter!</p><p><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Proton MT is live and ready to produce blocks.]]></title><description><![CDATA[We made the decision early on to partner with a local state-of-the-art data center.
